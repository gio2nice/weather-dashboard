# Weather-dashboard

## Description

In this project, we were asked to create a weather dashboard using the Openweather one call API. Where the user can search for a city then the city is added to the search history using local storage and the current weather conditions for that city is available to view. The user is then presented with the city name, the date, an icon representing weather conditions, the temp, humidity, the wind speed and the UV index. User is also presented with a 5-day forecast displaying the date, an icon of weather conditions, the wind speed, the temp and humidity.
